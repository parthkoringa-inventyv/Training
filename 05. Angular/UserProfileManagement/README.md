# Angular Assignment - User Profile Card

## Question

- You are building a User Profile Card using Angular + @angular/material.

## Requirements

- Create an Angular component called UserCardComponent that demonstrates ALL of the following:

  1. Data Binding
      - Interpolation -> Display user name and age 
      - One-way binding (Property Binding) -> Bind avatar image URL 
      - Two-way binding -> Edit user name using [(ngModel)] 
      - Event Binding -> Button click to toggle user status 
      - Class Binding -> Change card border color based on active/inactive status 

  2. Component Communication
      - Use @Input() to receive user data from parent 
      - Use @Output() to emit an event when user status changes 

  3. Lifecycle Hooks
     - Use at least:
        - ngOnInit 
        - ngOnChanges 
        - ngAfterViewInit 

  4. View Queries
     - Use:
        - @ViewChild() -> Access a single input field 
        - @ViewChildren() -> Access multiple Material buttons 

  5. Angular Material
     - Use:
        - MatCard 
        - MatInput 
        - MatButton 

  6. File Structure Discipline
      - Logic -> .ts 
      - Styling -> .css 
     - Template -> .html/

## Expected Output

 - A Material Card showing user details 
 - Editable user name 
 - Status toggle button 
 - Visual change when status updates 
 - Console logs proving lifecycle hooks & view queries work 

### Bonus (Optional)

- Disable the toggle button if the username is empty.

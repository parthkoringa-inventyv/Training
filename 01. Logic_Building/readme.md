# Flowchart Diagrams Collection

This directory contains a set of fundamental flowchart diagrams designed to explain basic programming logic, mathematical computations, series, and pattern generation using structured steps.

## Diagrams Overview

1. **Max of 3 Numbers**  
   Represents the logical comparison of three numbers to determine the greatest value among them using conditional checks.

2. **Max of 4 Numbers**  
   Illustrates the decision-making process required to find the maximum value from four given numbers efficiently.

3. **Sum of First N Numbers**  
   Demonstrates the iterative calculation of the sum of natural numbers from 1 to a given number `n`.

4. **Factorial of a Number**  
   Shows the step-by-step multiplication process to compute the factorial of a single number.

5. **Factorials Till Nth Numbers**  
   Depicts the repeated calculation of factorial values starting from 1 up to a specified number `n`.

6. **series: 1! −3! 5! −7! 9! (n = 5)**  
   Explains the generation of an alternating factorial series using odd numbers with positives and negatives.

7. **series: 1  −2  3  −4  5 (n = 5)**  
   Illustrates an alternating arithmetic series where signs change for consecutive natural numbers.

8. **Pattern: 1 12 123 1234 (n = 4)**  
   Represents a numeric pattern where each row appends the next natural number sequentially.

9. **Pattern: 1 121 12321 1234321 (n = 4)**  
   Shows the creation of a palindromic number pattern with increasing and decreasing sequences.

10. **Pattern: 1 232 34543 4567654 (n = 4)**  
    Demonstrates a complex symmetric number pattern where each row starts with an incremented value.

11. **Series: 1 1 1 3 2 5 3 7 5 9 8 11 13 13 (n = 7)**  
    Illustrates a mixed series combining odd numbers and fibonacci series.

12. **Series: x/1! − x³/3! + x⁵/5! − x⁷/7! (n = 4)**  
    Represents expression of Taylor Series Expansion of sin(x) (n = 4).
